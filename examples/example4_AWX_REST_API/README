The AWX/Tower REST API is easily accesible.
Just go to the following URL:

http://localhost/api/login

Here you log in using the credentials: admin/password

And now you can select the most current API version by clicking on it:

http://localhost/api/v2/

Here you can now explore the AWY/Tower API by yourself. You can basically do everything you could do from the AWX/Tower API.

So why not try to start a playbook for instance.
You should know how to run playbooks from the AWX/Tower GUI before you attempt to do it from here.

You could try to run the hello_world playbook for a start:

Go to:

http://localhost/api/v2/job_templates/5/launch/ 

and hit the POST button at the bottom of the page.

This should trigger a run of the hello_world playbook. Note that the number 5 in the above URL is the internal ID of the job template we are trying to run.
This ID may differ in your personal setup. 

Play around with the API a little bit to make yourself familiar with how to run playbooks etc.
